HOMEWORK: JS libraries Hackathon!
Explore - Play - Fiddle

Pick one of the libraries below and build something cool with it! This time, don’t worry about a strict plan, just make sure that whatever you do build, you have something to present by the end!  
Chances are quite high that you’ve never worked with or seen these libraries before - perfect! Once you pick a library you want to use, we strongly recommend you find a ‘getting started’ guide, or a tutorial to walk you through an example first. Then look back, modify, make something your own, customize.
What you should get out of this exercise:
Ability to get up and running quickly with a new technology


Broadened view of what you are currently capable of building, what’s possible


Exposure to different coding philosophies, structures, and patterns


Become more comfortable with reading documentation, diving into something unfamiliar


Fun
